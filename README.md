# Demo using requests, curses, and the Chuck Norris API

## Original code by Sean Zicari presented at PyCon 2013

## Changes

I updated this code to use the requests package. I also wrapped the
entire curses portion of the program with curses.wrapper. It exits more cleanly that way with the current version of Python.
